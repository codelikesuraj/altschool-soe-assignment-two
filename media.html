        <h2>Suffering from uniqueness</h2>
        <p>
          I have come to find out that having quite a unique set of names comes
          with its burden for others - PRONOUNCIATION.<br />I'm pretty sure if
          you're reading, you might have come across it and struggled just a
          little bit.<br />So below are audio notes of how to pronouce them, THE
          RIGHT WAY :)

        <h2>Surpassing my limit</h2>
        <p>
          Applying to AltSchool Africa to pick up a new skill seems pretty
          ballsy if you ask me.<br />I mean, as a Backend Developer you'd expect
          I'd want to improve on that or pick up Frontend.<br />But no, here I
          am diving head first into Cloud Engineering. Let's just say I'm
          following my intuition.<br />For a while now, I've found myself having
          to log into servers to perform routine google search powered tasks
          :)<br />So I guess deciding to formally learn this doesn't seem
          counter-intuitive at all.<br />Learning something new can be
          frustrating at first. No one ever said growth was simple.<br />So each
          time I feel frustrated, I remember my favorite character, Ippo, from
          the anime, Hajime No Ippo, saying,<br /><em
            >"I'm prepared to go past my limit!"</em
          >
